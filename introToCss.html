			<p> This is Keith Price's number one Fan Site! He is a good leader, wins games, throws awesome passes, hits his targets, can run when he needs to, and has a cheesy smile. Huskies have been on point this season with a starting record of 4-0. The Huskies smashed Boise State, pummeled Illinois, dominated Idaho State, and ran all over Arizona. <br /><br /> <span id="bow">Bow Down to Washington!!</span></p>

			<p> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is 
			a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of 
			ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence 
			that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a 
			paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence 
			long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer 
			to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
